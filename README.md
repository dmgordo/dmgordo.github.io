# The La Jolla Combinatorial Repository

This repository is a combination of databases I've constructed over the years,
This site provides a single *permanent* page to reference the
databases.  It contains a description of each of the database, and
links to them on zenodo.

This page may be viewed [here](dmgordo.github.io).

I made this by editing [Academic
Pages](academicpages.github.io), which let me quickly construct a
GitHub page without knowing much about Jekyll.
